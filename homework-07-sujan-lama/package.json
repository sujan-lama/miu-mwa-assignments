  "description": "Create an Express application that implements a Restful Stateless API for an entity called `students`: ```javascript let students = [{id: 1, name: \"Asaad Saad\", course: \"CS572\", grade: 95}] ``` * Take into consideration that `students` entity should be treated as an immutable data structure. * Have in mind to have a separation between the Routing layer and the Controllers layer.  * Write routes for the following CRUD operations and use the proper HTTP verbs (`GET` one and all,`POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`). * Test with `HTTP Client` extension for VSCode. (or any other client) * Your API accepts and returns `JSON` data from/to req/res body. * Log all requests to a file `access.log` using `morgan` middleware.  * For your `POST` and `PUT` routes, create and apply a custom middleware to verify if a the `JSON` object contains `name`, `course` and `grade`, otherwise send back an error. * Accept all cross-domain XHR requests using `cors` middleware.",
