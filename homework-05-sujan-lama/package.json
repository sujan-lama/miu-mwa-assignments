  "description": "* Create a new Express project:    1. `npm init`   2. Download the necessary dependencies: `npm i express superagent`. * When you receive a `GET` request to `/users?results=10`, fetch and return `10` users from `https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10`, use `superagent` and `async/await`. * Map the results and send the users firstname and lastname only. (Optional: use child process to map the results). ## Express configurations * Your API should hide the framework name from clients. * Your route should be case sensitive and strict. ## HTTP headers configurations * Send standard pagination headers in the response for the next and previous results pages (check the [pagination docs](https://randomuser.me/documentation#pagination) and [Express docs](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#res.links)). * Your server will have header details for Proxy servers not to cache the response, but allow the response to be cached at the client only for 1 minute.",
